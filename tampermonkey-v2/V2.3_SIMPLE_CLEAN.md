4. **Check Inbox** - Monitors for verification emails
5. **Auto-fill Code** - Fills verification code when received

## 🎨 UI:

---

## 🔧 Technical Details:

### Captcha Solver Algorithm:

```javascript
1. Find slider element (10+ common selectors)
2. Calculate drag distance (container width - slider width)
3. Simulate mouse events:
   - mousedown (start)
   - mousemove (drag in 20 steps)
   - mouseup (end)
4. Add random variations (looks human)
5. Try touch events (mobile captchas)
6. Try drag events (HTML5)
```

### Human-Like Behavior:
- 20 steps for smooth dragging
- 10ms delay between steps
- Random variations in Y position
- Realistic speed curve

## 📦 Installation:

1. Open Tampermonkey
2. Create new script
3. Copy `Tdjs-AutoReg-V2.3-Simple.user.js`
4. Save!
5. Go to vsphone.com

## 🎮 How to Use:

2. Click "➕ Create New Email"
   → Wait 5 seconds
   
3. Click "🎯 Auto-fill Form"
   → Form fills automatically
   → Captcha solves automatically!
   
4. Submit the form (click submit button)
   → Wait for email

```

### Manual Captcha Solve:
