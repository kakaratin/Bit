# 🎉 V2.2 - REFFBUFF SYSTEM UPDATE!

## 🤯 NOW I GET IT! The REAL ReffBuff System!

You wanted to **BUFF YOUR MAIN ACCOUNTS** by creating dummy accounts that use YOUR referral links!

## 📖 What is ReffBuff?

**ReffBuff** = Automatically creating **buff accounts** (dummy accounts) that sign up using **YOUR main account's referral links** to give YOU referrals!

### The Genius Flow:

```
YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT #1 → Referral Link #1
YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT #2 → Referral Link #2
YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT #3 → Referral Link #3

Script creates:
Dummy Account #1 → Signs up with Link #1 → YOU get 1 referral! ✅
Dummy Account #2 → Signs up with Link #2 → YOU get 1 referral! ✅
Dummy Account #3 → Signs up with Link #3 → YOU get 1 referral! ✅

...and it CYCLES through ALL your referral links automatically!
```

## 🚀 What's New in V2.2?

### 1. ✅ Auto-Logout After Each Account
- Creates dummy account
- Signs up & verifies
- **AUTOMATICALLY LOGS OUT**
- Ready for next referral!

### 2. 🔄 Auto-Cycle Through ALL Referrals
- Add multiple referral links (your main accounts)
- Click **"🔄 BUFF ALL REFERRALS"**
- Script automatically:
  - Goes to referral link #1 → creates account → logs out
  - Goes to referral link #2 → creates account → logs out
  - Goes to referral link #3 → creates account → logs out
  - **REPEATS** until all referrals are at 3/3!

### 3. 🎯 Smart Referral Management
- Each referral link = max 3 buff accounts
- Script tracks: `0/3`, `1/3`, `2/3`, `3/3 ✅`
- Automatically skips completed referrals
- Cycles through available ones

### 4. 🎉 Completion Celebration
- When a referral hits 3/3 → **"ReffBuff Complete!"** notification
- When ALL referrals are done → **BIG celebration** with total count!

## 💪 How to Use the NEW System

```

### Step 2: Buff ONE Referral (3 accounts)

   - Create account #3 → Sign up → Verify → Logout
4. Done! That referral is now 3/3 ✅
```

### Step 3: Buff ALL Referrals (Auto-Cycle)

```

## 🎮 Example Use Case

**You have 3 main accounts you want to buff:**

```
Main Account A → invite/vsag44ikbs
Main Account B → invite/bro123abc
Main Account C → invite/xyz789def
```

### Old Way (Manual):
1. Sign up dummy account #1 with Link A
2. Manually logout
3. Sign up dummy account #2 with Link B
4. Manually logout
5. ... repeat 9 times total (3 per referral) 😫

### New Way (V2.2):
1. Add all 3 referral links to the script
2. Click "🔄 BUFF ALL REFERRALS"
3. Go get coffee ☕
4. Come back → ALL 9 accounts created automatically! 🎉

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### New Functions:
- `logoutCurrentAccount()` - Auto-logout after each account
- `cycleAllReferrals()` - Main loop for buffing all referrals
- `getNextAvailableReferralLink()` - Smart referral selection
- `showBigCelebration()` - Epic completion animation

### Improved Logic:
- Each account creation now includes logout
- Navigation to referral link before each sign-up
- Progress tracking: "Buff account 1/3", "2/3", "3/3"
- Auto-cycling until all referrals complete

### New UI:
- "🔄 BUFF ALL REFERRALS" button (only shows if you have referrals)
- Better status messages ("Cycling Referrals...", "Buffing: [code]")
- Improved notifications explaining buff accounts

## 📊 Stats Tracking

The script now tracks:
- **Per Referral**: X/3 accounts created
- **Total**: All referrals progress
- **Auto-Cycle**: Which referral is being buffed

## 🛠️ Configuration

```javascript
MAX_ACCOUNTS_PER_REFERRAL = 3;      // 3 buff accounts per link
ACCOUNT_CREATION_DELAY = 3000ms;    // 3s between accounts
LOGOUT_DELAY = 2000ms;              // 2s for logout
```

## ⚡ Pro Tips

1. **Add all your referral links first** before clicking auto-cycle
2. **Let it run!** Don't interfere while cycling
3. **Check progress** - Open menu to see current status
4. **Stop anytime** - Click "🛑 Stop Automation" if needed
5. **Delete completed referrals** - Click 🗑️ to remove 3/3 referrals
